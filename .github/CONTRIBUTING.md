Thanks for considering the contribute to our project.  Here are few hints:

***Criticism is not a rejection.  If we do not like something or do not want something and will not support something we will explictly state so.  Otherwise all criticism is us asking for a change.  Even if it looks like we might be trying to be mean, I promise our intention is not to ever be mean.***


* All documentation requests are considered but it's preferable that if you
  know how to solve the problem, you submit a PR to address it.  Most if not
  all documentation updates are accepted.

* If a feature was available in 1.0-legacy and is not available in 2.0 read
  the documentation and make sure it's just not changed in some way, however
  if it's really important to you we will try to make it available again,
  not all features landed in 2.0 that were in 1.0 and that's because it was
  a ground up rewrite.  Re-additions are handled on a case-by-case basis
  but most are considered and accepted.

* If you would like a new feature please do the research and explain it
  as clearly as you can.  We will not do the research for you, once you can
  explain exactly what you want we'll be happy to implement it for you if it's not a crazy idea.  Our intention is not to exclude your feature, it's to
  make sure all features are clearly defined for a purpose.

  If you would like to implement it yourself that's great! We normally accept
  all feature requests as long as they don't pose a performance problem and
  even then we will work with you on fixing it up so it's cleaner.

If you have a problem that is not a bug or documentation issue you should use https://talk.jekyllrb.com to ask your question.  Most if not all non-bug non-documentation-bug problems will be rejected and closed asking you to ask your question on the forums so that other users can see it and help (including us) and use it for future reference.
