# Jekyll Assets

Jekyll assets is an asset pipeline using Sprockets 3 to build specifically for Jekyll. It utilizes new features of both Sprockets and Jekyll to try and achieve a clean and extensible assets platform.

## Using Jekyll Assets with Jekyll

```ruby
group :plugins do
  gem "jekyll-assets"
end
```

```yaml
gems:
  - jekyll-assets
```

## Configuration

The configuration file is the same as Jekyll's, which is _config.yml. Use the special key "assets":

```yaml
assets:
  compress:
    css: false | true | default - development: false, production: true
    js: false | true | default - development: false, production: true
  autowrite: true
  cache: false | directory | default: .asset-cache
  cache_type: memory | filesystem | default: filesystem
  cdn: https://cdn.example.com
  skip_baseurl_with_cdn: false
  skip_prefix_with_cdn: false
  prefix: "/assets"
  digest: true
  assets:
    - "*.png"
    - "bundle.css"
  sources:
    - _assets/css
    - _assets/images
    - _assets/javascripts
    - _assets/stylesheets
    - _assets/fonts
    - _assets/img
    - _assets/js
  features:
    liquid: true | false | default: false
    integrity: true | false | default: false
    # This will add height and width attributes for an img tag.
    automatic_img_size: true | false | n(fixnum): 2,4,6,8 | default: true
    # This will add the digest path as an alt attribute for an img tag.
    automatic_img_alt : true | false | default: true
```

### Liquid Processing with your Jekyll context

By default (whether `features.liquid` is `true` or `false`) we will process
all files with the extension `.liquid`, so if you give us `.scss.liquid`
we will parse the liquid and then we will parse the SCSS and finally
output your `.css` file. When `features.liquid` is set to `true`, we will process ***ALL*** files through Liquid, regardless of whether they have the `.liquid` extension. ***Use this at your own risk. As it can lead to some bugs, some bad output, and even some ugly edge cases... especially with things like Handlebars.***

### Cache Folder

If you plan to change the `cache` folder, please make sure to add that
folder to your `exclude` list in Jekyll, or you will generate over and over
and over again, `.` folders are not ignored by default as of Jekyll 3.x, so you should take heed of ignoring your own folders.

### Sources

The listed resources in the example are all defaults. It should be noted
that we append your sources instead of replace our resources with yours. So
if you add `_assets/folder` then we will append that to our sources and
both will work. ***NOTE: if you use our `_assets` base folder container as a base folder for your Sprockets, we will not append our sources, we will only use that folder as the sole source (base folder.)***

### Digesting

* Disable digesting by default in development.
* Digest by default in production.

***You can force digesting with `digest: true` in your `_config.yml`***

### Compression

* Requires sass and uglifier.
* Disable compression by default in development.
* Enable by default in production.

## Generating CSS with Jekyll Assets

The following section shows how to get started generating CSS using Jekyll
Assets. It applies to a newly generated Jekyll site, however this should helpanyone who has a Jekyll site. It should also be applicable for other types of assets.

### Create the `_assets/css` directory

The default [Jekyll Assets configuration](#configuration) expects to find all the assets in directories under `_assets`. Create a directory for the CSS:

```bash
mkdir -p _assets/css
```

### Move the CSS files to the new `_assets/css` directory

Jekyll comes with a `css` directory containing a `main.css` file and then a `_sass` directory with a few Sass imports. Move all of that to the `_assets/css` directory.

```bash
mv css/main.css _assets/css
mv _sass/* _assets/css
```

### Remove Jekyll front matter

Jekyll includes some empty [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) in `main.css`. Remove that as Sprockets will not understand it.

### Update the layout

The layout will no longer be pointing to the correct `main.css` file. Jekyll Assets supplies [liquid tags](#tags) to generate the correct HTML for these assets. Open `_includes/head.html` and replace the `<link>` to the CSS with:

```liquid
{% css main %}
```

Start up your local Jekyll server and if everything is correct, your site will be serving CSS via Sprockets. Read on for more information on how to customize your Jekyll Assets setup.

## Addons

* Font Awesome `gem "font-awesome-sass"`

  ```scss
    @import 'font-awesome-sprockets'
    @import 'font-awesome'
  ```

* CSS Auto-Prefixing `gem "autoprefixer-rails"`

    ```yml
    assets:
      autoprefixer:
        browsers:
          - "last 2 versions"
          - "IE > 9"
    ```

* Bootstrap `gem "bootstrap-sass"`

  ```scss
    @import 'bootstrap-sprockets'
    @import 'bootstrap'
  ```

* ES6 `gem "sprockets-es6"`
* Image Magick `gem "mini_magick"`
* ImageOptim `gem "image_optim"`

  ```yml
  assets:
    image_optim:
      default:
        verbose: true
      zero_png:
        advpng:
          level: 0
        optipng:
          level: 0
        pngout:
          strategy: 4
  ```

  Check the [ImageOptim docs](https://github.com/toy/image_optim#configuration) to get idea about configuration options.

* LESS `gem "less"`

## Bower

Modify your `.bowerrc` file and add:

```json
{
  "directory": "_assets/bower"
}
```

And then add `_assets/bower` to your sources list and Sprockets will do the
the rest for you... you can even `//= require bower_asset.js`. We will even
compress them for you per normal if Sprockets supports it and allows us to.

***You do not need to modify your `.bowerrc` file, you can optionally just
add it to your sources list and it will work that way too! As long as it's in
your Jekyll folder.***

## Tags

* image, img
* javascript, js
* stylesheet, css, style
* asset, asset_source
* asset_path

### Tag Example:

```liquid
{% img src magick:2x alt:'This is my alt' %}
{% img src magick:2x alt:'This is my alt' sprockets:accept:image/gif %}
```

### What do the colons mean? Proxies/Tags

* `argument` is a boolean HTML argument.
* `key:value` is an HTML key="value" if no proxy exists.
* `proxy:key:value` will set a proxy key with the given value.
* `proxy:key` is a boolean argument if the proxy and key exists.
* `unknown:key:value` will raise `DoubleColonError`, escape it.
* `proxy:unknown:value` will raise a `UnknownProxyError`.

Lets say we have `sprockets` proxies and sprockets allows you to proxy accept,
if you send `{% img src sprockets:accept:image/gif }` then Sprockets find_asset
will get `{ :accept => "image/gif" }` but if you try to proxy "unknown" on
sprockets we will raise a Proxy error. For more information then look at
`parser_spec.rb` in the spec folder because it literally lays out the ground
rules for our tags as a specification.

### Current Proxies:

* `sprockets:accept:<value>`
* `sprockets:write_to:<value>`

## Liquid Variables

We support liquid arguments for tag values (but not tag keys), and we also
support Liquid pre-processing (with your Jekyll context) sass/less/css files
you need do nothing special for the preprocessing an entire file, it's
always done.

An example of using Liquid in your tags:

```liquid
{% img '{{ image_path }}' %}
{% img '{{ image_path }}' proxy:key:'{{ value }}' %}
{% img {{\ image_path\ }} %}
```

An example of using Liquid in your SCSS:

```scss
.bg {
  background: url(asset_path("{{ site.background_image }}"));
}
```

You have full access to your entire Jekyll context from any liquid
processing we do, so you can do whatever you like and be as dynamic as you
like, including full loops and conditional Liquid based CSS since we
pre-process your text files.

## Getting a list of your assets and basic info from Liquid

We provide all *your* assets as a hash of Liquid Drops so you can get basic
info that we wish you to have access to without having to prepare the class.

```liquid
{{ assets["bundle.css"].content_type }} => "text/css"
{{ assets["images.jpg"].width  }} => 62
{{ assets["images.jpg"].height }} => 62
```

The current list of available accessors:

* `logical_path`
* `content_type` -> `type`
* `filename`
* `basename`
* `width`
* `height`
* `digest_path`

If you would like more, please feel free to add a pull request, at this
time we will reject all pull requests that wish to add any digested paths as
those are dynamically created when a proxy is ran so we can never predict
it reliably unless we proxy and that would be a performance problem.

### Dynamically loading assets

Using Liquid Drop `assets`, you can check whether an asset is present.

```liquid
{% if assets[page.image] %}
  {% img '{{ page.image }}' %}
{% else %}
  {% img 'default.jpg' %}
{% endif %}
```

## ERB Support

ERB Support is removed in favor of trying to get this included on Github Pages
eventually (if I can.) Having ERB presents a security risk to Github because it
would allow you to use Ruby in ways they don't want you to.

## Filters

There is a full suite of filters, actually, any tag and any proxy can be a
filter by way of filter arguments, take the following example:

```liquid
{{ src | img : "magick:2x magick:quality:92" }}
```

### Jekyll Assets Multi

Jekyll Assets has a special called `jekyll_asset_multi` which is meant to be used for things like the header, where it would be nice to be able to include multiple assets at once.  You can use it like so:

```liquid
{{ 'css:bundle.css "js:bundle.js async:true"' | jekyll_asset_multi }}
```

## Hooks

* `:env => [:init]`

You can register and trigger hooks like so:

```ruby
Jekyll::Assets::Hook.register :env, :init do
  # Your Work
end
```

## Combining Multiple Scripts / Stylesheets

To minimize the number of HTTP requests, combine stylesheets and scripts into one file.

### SCSS

Use the `@import` statement. Given a list of files in `_assets/css`:

- `main.scss`
- `_responsive.scss`
- `_fonts.scss`

...have this in your `main.scss`:

```scss
@import 'responsive';
@import 'fonts';
// ...
```

Include the `main` stylesheet in your HTML: `{% css main %}`.

### JavaScript

Use `//= require` to import and bundle component scripts into one file. More from [#241](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-assets/issues/241).

Given a list of files in `_assets/js`:

- `main.js`
- `jquery.js`

...have this in your `main.js`:

```js
//= require jquery
// ...
```

Include the `main` script in your HTML: `{% js main %}`.

## Sass Helpers

***Our currently supported helpers are:***

* asset_url
* asset_path
* image_path
* font_path
* image_url
* font_url

### Image Magick Proxy arguments:

**NOTE: You'll need the `mini_magick` gem installed for these to work**
To install `mini_magick`, add `gem "mini_magick"` to your `Gemfile`

See the [MiniMagick docs](https://github.com/minimagick/minimagick#usage)
to get an idea what `<value>` can be.

* `magick:resize:<value>`
* `magick:format:<value>`
* `magick:quality:<value>`
* `magick:rotate:<value>`
* `magick:gravity:<value>`
* `magick:crop:<value>`
* `magick:flip:<value>`
* `magick:quadruple`, `magick:4x`
* `magick:one-third`, `magick:1/3`
* `magick:three-fourths`, `magick:3/4`
* `magick:two-fourths`, `magick:2/4`
* `magick:two-thirds`, `magick:2/3`
* `magick:one-fourth`, `magick:1/4`
* `magick:half`, `magick:1/2`

### ImageOptim Proxy arguments:

**NOTE: You'll need the `image_optim` gem installed for these to work**
To install `image_optim`, add `gem "image_optim"` to your `Gemfile`

See the [ImageOptim docs](https://github.com/toy/image_optim#gem-installation) to ensure proper dependencies installation.

* `image_optim:default` same as `image_optim:preset:default`
* `image_optim:preset:<name>`
